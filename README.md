Blood Donation Prediction
Overview
This project leverages machine learning to predict the likelihood of blood donation based on past donation patterns and demographic data. The goal is to aid blood banks and healthcare providers in strategizing blood donation drives more effectively.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared raw data to ensure high-quality input for the machine learning model.
Model Development: Built and trained predictive models using Python libraries such as scikit-learn.
Visualization: Created data visualizations to identify trends and insights in blood donation patterns.
Accuracy Optimization: Improved the model's prediction accuracy by tuning hyperparameters and selecting the best algorithm.
Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Tools: Jupyter Notebook
Dataset
The dataset includes historical data on blood donation, such as:

Demographic details
Donation frequency
Time since last donation

Results
Identified key factors influencing blood donation behavior.

Future Enhancements
Incorporate real-time data to improve prediction accuracy.
